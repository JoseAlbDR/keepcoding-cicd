## FEATURES

### Authentication

Nodepop-adv uses bcrypt to hash and secure passwords and JWT for authentication. Upon signing up, user data is stored in the database with the hashed password. The login endpoint handles password validation and sends back a token in a cookie. The Auth middleware authenticates by validating the received token in the cookie and sets a new property in the body called 'user' with the payload from the token.

### Internationalization

Nodepop-adv uses the i18n library to internationalize the application. Accessing [http://localhost:${PORT}](http://localhost:${PORT}) will display a frontend page showing the current products in the database. On this page, two flags are visibleâ€”one for Spanish language and one for English language. By clicking on them, users can switch the language of the page.

### Image Upload with Thumbnail Background Task

Nodepop-adv utilizes express-fileupload to handle the upload of product images. When an image is uploaded, it is stored in `${PUBLIC_FOLDER}/${UPLOADS_FOLDER}/products` (default: public/uploads/products). The uploaded image name is generated based on the original name plus a unique identifier.

A thumbnail is generated during the image upload process using Cote for the microservice and jimp to build the thumbnail. Within the FileUploadService, an event called 'generate-thumbnail' is triggered, and the ThumbnailMicroservice listens for this event to generate the thumbnail.
